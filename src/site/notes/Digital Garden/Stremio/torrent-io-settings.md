# Configuring Torrentio

Once you install Torrentio, customize your settings for the best experience.

## Important Settings to Configure:

- **Debrid Service**: Choose either Real-Debrid or AllDebrid.
- **Source Filters**:
  - Hide low-quality streams.
  - Prioritize cached torrents.
- **Resolution Filters**:
  - Filter sources based on resolution (e.g., prioritize 1080p or 4K).
- **Auto-Resolve Streams**:
  - Enable if you want Stremio to automatically pick the best stream.

After configuring, **save your Torrentio URL** and re-install the add-on with the updated URL if needed.
