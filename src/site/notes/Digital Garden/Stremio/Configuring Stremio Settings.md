# Configuring Torrentio and USA TV Add-ons

Once you’ve installed Stremio and created your account, the next step is configuring your most important add-ons for content: **Torrentio** and **USA TV**.

These will give you access to a wide variety of movies, TV shows, and live U.S. television streams.

## 🎬 Torrentio Configuration (On-Demand Streaming)

Torrentio is one of the most popular community add-ons for accessing movies and TV shows via torrent-based streams. Here's how to configure it properly:

### 1. Visit the Torrentio Setup Page  
- Go to: [https://torrentio.strem.fun/setup](https://torrentio.strem.fun/setup)

### 2. Configure the Following Settings:

- **Debrid Service**:  
  - Choose **Real-Debrid** or **AllDebrid** to access premium cached torrents.
  - This is highly recommended for faster and more reliable streams.
  - For help choosing, see [[realdebrid-vs-alldebrid\|realdebrid-vs-alldebrid]].

- **Source Filters**:  
  - Enable **"Cached torrents only"**  
  - Enable **"Hide low-quality releases"**

- **Resolution Filters**:  
  - You can choose to prioritize or filter out 720p, 1080p, or 4K content.

- **Auto-Resolve Streams**:  
  - Turn this on if you want Stremio to auto-play the best source without prompting you to choose.

### 3. Save and Install

- After setting your preferences, the site will generate a unique **Torrentio install link**.
- Open the link to install it directly to your Stremio account.
- If you change your settings later, you’ll need to re-install using an updated link.

## 📺 USA TV Add-on Configuration (Live TV)

The USA TV add-on gives you access to publicly available U.S. live TV streams — great for local news, network television, and more.

### 1. Install the Add-on

- Visit: [https://stremio-addons.com/usa-tv.html](https://stremio-addons.com/usa-tv.html)
- Click the **“Install (Web)”** button
- This will add USA TV to your Stremio account

### 2. What You Get

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> The USA TV add-on offers a large list of **publicly accessible streaming channels** from U.S. networks.  
> Stream quality and availability may vary, and these are not curated or guaranteed by Stremio itself.

There are no user-configurable settings required for this add-on — just install and start browsing live channels.
