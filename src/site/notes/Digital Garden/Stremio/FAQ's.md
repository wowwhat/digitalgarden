# Streaming FAQ

Welcome to the Streaming FAQ! This page addresses common questions about Stremio, Torrentio, debrid services, and related topics.

---

## ❓ What is a cache?

A **cache** refers to a storage location where frequently accessed data is stored for quick retrieval. In the context of streaming, services like Real-Debrid or All-Debrid cache popular torrent files on their servers. This means when you stream content, you're accessing these pre-downloaded files, resulting in faster and more reliable playback.

---

## ❓ What is a torrent?

A **torrent** is a file-sharing protocol that allows users to distribute data over the internet in a decentralized manner. Instead of downloading a file from a single source, torrents enable downloading pieces of the file from multiple users simultaneously. This method is efficient for sharing large files.

---

## ❓ What is Stremio?

**Stremio** is a media center application that allows you to organize and stream video content from various sources, including movies, TV shows, live TV, and web channels. By installing add-ons like Torrentio, you can access a vast library of content aggregated from different platforms.

---

## ❓ Is this legal?

Using Stremio and its official add-ons is legal. However, some third-party add-ons may provide access to copyrighted content without proper authorization. Streaming such content might infringe on copyright laws in your jurisdiction. It's essential to be aware of local laws and use discretion when accessing content.

---

## ❓ What are the odds I get caught using a debrid service?

Debrid services like Real-Debrid and All-Debrid act as intermediaries, fetching content on your behalf. While they offer a layer of anonymity, no system is entirely foolproof. The risk of getting caught is relatively low, especially when streaming cached content. However, always exercise caution and consider using additional privacy measures.

---

## ❓ Do I need a VPN?

While not mandatory, using a **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic and masking your IP address. This adds an extra layer of security, especially when accessing content through third-party add-ons.

---

## ❓ Will this ever go down?

The streaming setup described relies on multiple third-party services:

- **Torrentio**: An add-on that aggregates torrent links. As a third-party service, it might become unavailable without notice.
- **Debrid Services**: Platforms like Real-Debrid or All-Debrid can experience outages or policy changes.
- **USA TV Add-on**: Managed by an individual, channel availability can fluctuate, and downtime might occur.

While the system is generally reliable, it's essential to understand that these services are not officially supported. Downtime can happen, and there's no guaranteed uptime or support.

---

## ❓ Can I use this on an Apple TV?

Stremio doesn't have an official app for Apple TV. However, you can:

- **AirPlay**: Stream content from your iOS device or Mac to Apple TV using AirPlay.
- **Screen Mirroring**: Mirror your device's screen to Apple TV.

These methods allow you to enjoy Stremio content on your Apple TV, albeit indirectly.
