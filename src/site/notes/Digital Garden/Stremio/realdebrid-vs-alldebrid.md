# Real-Debrid vs All-Debrid

When using Torrentio with Stremio, you'll need a debrid service to access premium cached streams.

## Real-Debrid
- ✅ Larger library of cached torrents.
- ✅ Generally faster and more reliable.
- ❌ No automatic renewal / auto-pay feature.
- ❌ Payment sometimes tricky — cards may decline because charges originate from France.

> **Note**: Sometimes users have better luck paying with PayPal or a virtual card.
