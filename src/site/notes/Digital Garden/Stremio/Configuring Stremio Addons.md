# Configuring Torrentio and USA TV Add-ons

Once you’ve installed Stremio and created your account, the next step is configuring your most important add-ons for content: **Torrentio** and **USA TV**.

These will give you access to a wide variety of movies, TV shows, and live U.S. television streams.

---

## 🎬 Torrentio Configuration (On-Demand Streaming)

Torrentio is one of the most popular community add-ons for accessing movies and TV shows via torrent-based streams. Here's how to configure it properly:

### 1. Visit the Torrentio Setup Page  
- Go to: [https://torrentio.strem.fun/setup](https://torrentio.strem.fun/setup)

### 2. Configure the Following Settings:

- **Debrid Service**:  
  - Choose **Real-Debrid** or **AllDebrid** to access premium cached torrents.
  - This is highly recommended for faster and more reliable streams.
  - For help choosing, see [[realdebrid-vs-alldebrid\|realdebrid-vs-alldebrid]].

- **Source Filters**:  
  - Enable **"Cached torrents only"**  
  - Enable **"Hide low-quality releases"**

- **Resolution Filters**:  
  - You can choose to prioritize or filter out 720p, 1080p, or 4K content.

- **Auto-Resolve Streams**:  
  - Turn this on if you want Stremio to auto-play the best source without prompting you to choose.

### 3. Save and Install

- After setting your preferences, the site will generate a unique **Torrentio install link**.
- Open the link to install it directly to your Stremio account.
- If you change your settings later, you’ll need to re-install using an updated link.

## 📺 USA TV Add-on Configuration (Live TV)

The USA TV add-on gives you access to publicly available U.S. live TV streams — great for local news, network television, and more.

### 1. Install the Add-on

- Visit: [https://stremio-addons.com/usa-tv.html](https://stremio-addons.com/usa-tv.html)
- Click the **“Install (Web)”** button
- This will add USA TV to your Stremio account

### 2. What You Get

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> The USA TV add-on offers a large list of **publicly accessible streaming channels** from U.S. networks.  
> Stream quality and availability may vary, and these are not curated or guaranteed by Stremio itself.

There are no user-configurable settings required for this add-on — just install and start browsing live channels.

After setting up Torrentio and USA TV, you’ll be able to stream most content directly from within Stremio — including via Android TV and mobile. For platform-specific guides, see:

# Configuring Torrentio and USA TV Add-ons

Once you’ve created your Stremio account, the next step is setting up the key add-ons for watching movies, TV shows, and live U.S. television streams.

We'll focus on **Torrentio** (for on-demand movies and shows) and **USA TV** (for live TV).

---

## 🎬 Torrentio Setup (Movies & TV Shows)

Torrentio is a community-created add-on that pulls streaming links from a wide variety of public torrent sources.

%3E ⚠️ **Quick Disclaimer:**  
> Torrentio itself does **not host any content** — it simply indexes publicly available files from across the internet.  
> Streaming DMCA-protected content **directly** from torrents could violate copyright law.  
>  
> However, by using a **Debrid service** (like Real-Debrid or All-Debrid), you are connecting to **already cached copies** stored securely on remote servers.  
> This means:
> - You are **not downloading** or **sharing** the torrent directly.
> - Your connection is **encrypted and untraceable** to you.

---

### 1. Configure Torrentio

- Go to: [https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure)

You’ll see a list of options to customize your experience:

---

### Torrentio Setup Options

#### ✅ Providers
- **What it is:** The list of sites Torrentio searches for links.
- **Recommended:** Leave these settings at default. No changes needed.

#### ✅ Sorting
- **What it is:** Controls how results are ordered.
- **Recommended Setting:**  
  - **First by Quality**, then **by Seeders** (number of people sharing the file).
  - This puts the highest quality and most reliable streams first.

#### ✅ Exclude Qualities/Resolutions
- **What it is:** Filters out low-quality or bad copies.
- **Recommended Setting:**  
  - Exclude: **Screener**, **CAM**, and **Unknown**.
  - This mostly eliminates blurry or unstable streams.

#### ✅ Max Results Per Quality
- **What it is:** Limits how many streams are shown for each resolution.
- **Recommended Setting:**  
  - Set between **3 to 5**.
  - Lower = fewer options, cleaner interface.  
  - Higher = more versions to choose from but more scrolling.

#### ✅ Video Size Limit
- **What it is:** Maximum file size for streams.
- **Recommended Setting:**  
  - Leave this **blank** unless you specifically want to avoid very large files.

---

### 2. Debrid Setup

If you want **premium, fast, and cached streams**, you must connect a **Debrid service**:

- **Debrid Provider:**  
  - Choose **Real-Debrid** or **All-Debrid**.

- **Real-Debrid API Key:**  
  - If you're using Real-Debrid, you'll need to enter your personal API Key.  
  - **[Find your Real-Debrid API Key here](https://real-debrid.com/apitoken)** after logging into your account.

- **Debrid Options:**  
  (These options are advanced and can usually be left alone.)
  - **Don't show download to debrid links:** Hides non-streamable links.
  - **Don't show debrid catalog:** Hides full debrid site catalogs.
  - **None:** Leaves all options visible.

*By the time you reach this step, it’s assumed you’ve already signed up for a Debrid service and retrieved your API Key.*

---

### 3. Save and Install Torrentio

After customizing your settings:
- Click **Save**.
- You’ll get a **custom Torrentio install link**.
- Open the link to install Torrentio directly into your Stremio account.

If you ever change your settings later, you’ll need to re-install using an updated link.
